My first non guided personal project with a text basedlike incremental necromancer game. Gather mana to summon creatures to fight enemies to use their corpses to summon creatures to use as companions, materials, tools, weapons etc. I want to add time travelling, fighting robots, merging necromancy with technology... We'll see where it goes.
